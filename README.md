# Face Recognition with TensorFlow Object Detection API
A face recognition project using tensorflow objection detection API

The model is trained to detect my face for now but you can add more faces and data to train accordingly 

## Environment Requirements:

* Python 3.7.4
* Tensorflow 2.4.1
* Cuda Toolkit 11.0
* Cudnn 8.0

## Installation
*  Anaconda Environment
*  Tensorflow 
*  Object Detection Api
* Use **Tensorflow Version: 2.4.1** & **Python Version: 3.7.4** as it works perfectly without any dependancy issues.
* Follow [official installation tutorial](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to install all dependancies.

## Collecting Data, Training & Testing 
* Follow the steps given in [Tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/ishangala16/face-recognition-tensorflow-object-detection-api/blob/main/Tutorial.ipynb).

## Real Time Face Recognition
* Use [Load_detect.py](https://github.com/ishangala16/face-recognition-tensorflow-object-detection-api/blob/main/load_detect.py) to load your trained model (latest checkpoint) & perform realtime face recognition.
